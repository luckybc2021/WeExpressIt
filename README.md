# WeExpressIt App

This repository contains a .NET 8 Blazor WebAssembly application created to demonstrate and test the capabilities of the VUI (Vietnam User Interfaces) Razor library.

## About VUI

VUI (Vietnam User Interfaces) is a Razor library that provides a set of user interface components designed with a focus on Vietnamese users, but also adaptable for users from other countries. It includes a variety of components such as buttons, forms, navigation menus, and more. While it has been tailored to meet the needs of applications targeting Vietnamese users, its flexible design allows it to be easily used in applications targeting users from other regions as well.

## About WeExpressIt

The test application in this repository serves as a sandbox for developers to explore the features of the VUI library. It includes examples of various VUI components and their usage.

## Creator

This project was created by Vo Song Toan with the purpose of contributing to the developer community in Vietnam and around the world. The goal is to provide a free, open-source library of Razor components that can be used in any Blazor application.
